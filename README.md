# BASE PYTHON MODULE

## This basic setup contains the initial configuration I use for python projects for modules.

## INSTALL

1. Make a `virtualenv` or `pipenv` and `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all dependencies.
2. With the activated environment, run the `setup.py` file to install the `base-python-module` and the code included to run within environment.
3. Install the test dependencies listed on `test_requirements.txt` in order to run tests.
4. Run `pytest` to run the tests. A `report.html` file will be created in the report directory with all test execution details.
